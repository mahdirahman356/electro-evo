## Project Overview

ElectroEvo is an innovative platform designed to help users manage and troubleshoot issues related to their electronic devices. Users can easily post and share problems they encounter with their electronics, fostering a collaborative environment where solutions and recommendations can be exchanged. This interactive platform not only allows users to add, update, and delete their queries, but also provides a space for viewing and contributing recommendations. The goal is to empower users with the information they need to find alternative products and make more informed purchasing decisions.

## Features

- **Major Feature 1:** Users can post and share detailed descriptions of the problems they experience with their electronic devices, enabling others to offer solutions or share similar experiences.
- **Major Feature 2:**  Users have full control over their posts, with the ability to update and delete their entries as needed. This ensures that the information remains relevant and up-to-date.
- **Major Feature 3:** In addition to troubleshooting, users can recommend high-quality products, share photos, and provide detailed reviews. This helps build a repository of trusted recommendations for others to consult.
